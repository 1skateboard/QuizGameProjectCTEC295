This is a project for avid learners and knowledge seekers.  A fun quiz game for users to test their knowledge.  

This project is attempted by three schoolmates in our CTEC 295 class.  We will update the project as we learn together.

Thank you for joining us.

I had made some changes to the quiz page prior and realized 25 questions might be a bit too much for fun.  
After several questions it doesn't become fun anymore.  
So for now the quiz is 5 questions at a time.  
User pages will log scores and when those are complete it will update to have those.
Also OpenTriviaDB API won't populate links and categories.  Had to use the developer links that doesn't diffrentiate categories.
Will look into a different Trivia API if necessary.

Got user icons from thenounproject.com. I just got a few to put in the user icon box.
